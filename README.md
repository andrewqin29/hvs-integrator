# Kinematic Analysis and Orbit Integration of Hypervelocity Stars

This repository contains the data processing pipelines, analysis scripts, and visualization notebooks for a research project investigating the origins of hypervelocity stars (HVS). The primary goal is to analyze the kinematics of the 21 HVS from the HVS Survey to test the hypothesis that a significant fraction originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) rather than the Galactic Center (Sgr A*).

The project uses observational data from the Gaia DR3 dataset, processes it into a 6D Galactocentric Cartesian frame with propagated errors via Monte Carlo methods, and provides tools for kinematic analysis and past orbit integration.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the local environment and run the pipelines, follow these steps. This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:andrewqin29/hvs-integrator.git
cd hvs-integrator
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv hvs_env

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source hvs_env/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Workflow and Usage

The project is designed as a sequential pipeline. The scripts in the `scripts/` directory must be run first to generate the necessary data, which can then be explored in the `notebooks/`.

**Step 1: Generate Processed Data**

Run the following scripts from the command line in order. They will read the raw data, query Gaia, and perform the Monte Carlo transformation.

```bash
# Script 1: Cleans raw data and queries Gaia for full observational data
python scripts/get_gaia_data.py

# Script 2: Converts observational data to Cartesian coordinates with with errors and 6x6 covariance matrices.
python scripts/make_cartesian_data.py
```
Upon completion, the processed data files will be saved in the `data/processed/` directory.

**Step 2: Interactive Analysis and Visualization**

Once the data is generated, you can explore it using the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

* **`notebooks/data_generation.ipynb`**: Contains the original exploratory code and development scratchpad for the data processing pipelines.
* **`notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb`**: Loads the final Cartesian data to produce all diagnostic plots (Aitoff projections, 3D quiver plots, histograms, etc.).
* **`notebooks/orbit_integration.ipynb`**: The development notebook for building and validating the custom Leapfrog orbit integrator.
